# MEV-Research

Welcome! In this repo, you can **suggest an edit to any parts of a FRP, start a conversation on any point of a FRP or join a research team working on a FRP.**  

Our FRP teams are coordinated by our Research Fellows, who will be reviewing your edit suggestions, respond to your comments and on-board you as a research contributor should you mutually like working together. 

**What is a Research Fellow?**
</br> A Research Fellow is part of our core research team and explores research directions. Learn more about becoming a Research Fellow here.

**What is a FRP?**
</br> FRP stands for Flashbots Research Proposal. An FRP is a design document proposing a new research question to the Flashbots research community.

We intend Flashbots to be an open research organization where FRPs are the primary mechanism for anyone in the ecosystem to suggest and contribute to research.

**Bootstrapping FRPs**
</br> Initially, we are a lean and fast-moving organization with clear short-term research goals. With that in mind, we have submitted X FRPs which are core to our research efforts in the next months. FRPs will be open for community submissions in early 2021, until then we’d like to collaborate with the community on our existing FRPs.

**Current Asks:**
</br> Comment on an existing FRP by submitting an edit to it through a pull request or by creating an issue in the Research repo to open a discussion on a particular point of the FRP.
