# Flashbots Research Proposal

### Summary

This research proposal examines potential inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement in based rollups.

The research methodology will prioritize identifying general patterns and employing abstract modeling techniques. This approach ensures that findings are constructive, emphasizing systemic improvements while mitigating risks of exploitative applications. Deliverables will consist of actionable recommendations that promote the sustainable development of based rollups, safeguarding against unintended misuse and reinforcing their alignment with Ethereum's core values.

### Background and Problem Statement

Based rollups are an integral part of the Ethereum scalability roadmap, providing enhanced throughput and lower transaction costs. The idea behind based rollups is to integrate the L1 proposer for sequencing and settlement, achieving this without relying on centralized sequencers. However, as the ecosystem matures, challenges in operational efficiency and design scalability may arise.

This research aims to investigate:

1. What broad operational inefficiencies might exist within based rollups?
2. How can rollup mechanisms be optimized to align with decentralization and scalability goals?
3. What high-level insights can support the ecosystem's long-term growth and security?

The focus will be on promoting a deep understanding of based rollups, specifically in how sequencing is achieved and where MEV is extracted compared to traditional L2 solutions.

### Plan and Deliverables

Approach:

1. Data Analysis: Analyze publicly available data to identify key trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement in based rollups.
2. Modeling and Simulation: Create high-level simulations to assess the potential impact of proposed optimizations.
3. Collaboration and Feedback: Present generalized findings to relevant based rollups teams to gather constructive feedback and insights.

Phases:

- Phase 1 (1 Month): Conduct data collection and perform trend analysis to identify areas of interest and inefficiency.
- Phase 2 (2 Months): Develop abstract models and conduct in-depth analysis of potential optimizations for based rollups.
- Phase 3 (1 Month): Synthesize findings into actionable insights and prepare recommendations for further exploration and implementation.

Deliverables:

- A comprehensive report summarizing key trends, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.
- Abstract models demonstrating the effects of proposed optimizations on based rollups.
- Strategic recommendations for based rollups teams to explore and implement optimizations within the ecosystem.
