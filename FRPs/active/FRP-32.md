The redistribution of cryptocurrency funds to collectives working in close relation with the land in the global south intends to enable new economic circles that are glocal, transparent, abundant, and connected to the more-than-human world. 

This research project is geared to bring forth the benefits and challenges experienced by collectives and their communitites in the receival and use of crytocurrency funds through a series of a qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews. Considering that not all recipients of crytocurrency funds are crypto-natives, our purpose is to evaluate the ways in which accesing and investing the funds are taking place, the local understanding of crypto-use, and how the funds are converted to a currency received by the local community. This is our initial exploration on the redistribution of the extra economic value generated by cryptocurrencies and how it is being directed to local communities on the margins of the dominant economy.

Our main limitation is the existing gap between technological intelligence in crypto-use and local, historical understanding of economic functioning under current capitalist markets. This project hopes to bring forth awareness of current benefits and challenges of accesing cyrtocurrency funds from a community-focused, social-justice approach.
