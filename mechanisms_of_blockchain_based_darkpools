# **Background and Problem Statement**

Dark pools have been an essential component of traditional finance since the early 90s, providing venues for trading large blocks of securities away from the public eye. As of 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had registered 60 dark pools. These Traditional dark pools are run by trusted operators such as exchanges, like the NYSE or NASDAQ; some are broker-dealer-operated, like MS Pool by Morgan Stanley and SigmaX by Goldman Sachs; and some are independently operated, like Liquidnet or MatchNow.

While dark pools offer the advantage of privacy and minimizing market impact for large trades, they are not without controversy. The very operators trusted to run these pools have, on numerous occasions, been found guilty of abusing their privileged positions. Misconduct has included trading against their users, leading to a cumulative $340 million in fines imposed by the SEC for various infractions. These attacks have been continual despite of regulatory actions because the Profit from Corruption is far greater than the cost of corruption. 

Blockchain-based dark pools on the other hand, aim to abstract the need for trust in a single operator. Leveraging Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), these dark pools aim to ensure both pre-execution and post-execution privacy. 

This study aims to uncover the following dark pool designs.

- [Renegade](https://renegade.fi/), with a crossing network based design, uses a UTXO based system and will be deployed using Arbitrum’s Orbit. It uses a combination of Ultra-ponk based Zero knowledge proof system and enshrined MPC.
- [Tristero](https://www.tristero.xyz/) with an orderbook based uses an account model and a network of Intel SGX TEE nodes. It uses “salted” intents.
- Panther Protocol, an orderbook, uses a combination of an MASP and a time based escrow contract to source liquidity externally.
- [Singularity](https://www.thesingularity.network/) with a hybrid orderbook-AMM design, also uses a UTXO based system. It relies on a network of FHE nodes and an Ultra-plonk based zero knowledge proof system.
- [Penumbra](https://penumbra.zone/) with an CL-AMM based on a UTXO model. It uses a groth16 ZK proof system with homomorphic pedersen commitments.
- Enclave Markets, a CEX running a cros crossing network and a CLOB. It uses TEEs for confidential compute.
- CT+2, a DEX based on SUAVE that utilizes batch auctions and is designed to source liquidity externally.

But even blockchain based dark pools backed by cryptography primitives need to be questioned to test their mantel of privacy. This FRP aims to question the effectiveness and resilience of today’s blockchain based dark pool designs. Specifically, 

- How "dark" are these blockchain-based dark pools?
- Can they effectively mitigate risks related to MEV, collusion, trust parties, and information asymmetry?
- If the order flow routing off of dark pools is to settle on Ethereum, how do its privacy guarantees hold up at the block building and settling periods?
- If the order flow is routing off of L2s, can the L2’s sequencer have a peak at its order flow?

This research proposal seeks to investigate these questions, exploring whether blockchain-based dark pools can overcome the inherent challenges faced by traditional dark pools and if they are a step above.

# **Plan and Deliverables**

We plan to produce a paper and present our findings at a conference 

A few steps we plan to take as a part of our study

- Survey dark pool teams (Renegade, Tristero, Singularity and Penumbra)
- Survey dark pool users such as market makers, solvers, and liquid funds
- Quantitative analysis of
    - latency & Settlement
    - Proof generation costs & time
    - Quality of pricing
- Establish Desired Properties of Dark Pools
    - Pre-execution Privacy
    - Order Matching Mechanisms (Mid-point, Price Time Priority, batching
    - Nature of Liquidity
    - Post-execution Privacy
    - MEV Resistance & Degree of Programmability to accommodate good MEV
    - Censorship Resistance
- Thoroughly analyze each design’s trade-offs and map out potential attack vectors, points of information asymmetry, collusion and trust assumptions.
- Highlight points of information leakage that could lead to MEV extraction
- Analyze levels of LVR vulnerability in AMM based designs
- Consolidation, drafting publication

We will also hold discussions with teams building private defi and share our findings
